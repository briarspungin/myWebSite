<h4>Why She's My Hero</h4>
<p>Ainsley Henderson is my hero because her favorite Taylor Swift song is "The Way I Loved You (Taylor's Version)". Why does this make Ainsley my hero? you might ask. For the simple reason that i am also a Swiftie and this conincidence has sustained our bond throughout the last five years.
